			<p class="info">Hi all!! I am Shirin Shukkoor,<br> an IT undergraduate who loves to solve problems and a quick learner.Seeking to leverage
 acquired academic knowledge and experience to solve real world problems. Technology enthusiast who is curious to learn new things and experiment
 with acquired knowledge.<br>
Basically, I belong to Kerala. I have been living in Malappuram dist . I stay here with my family.
Besides my parents, there is a younger brother and a sister in my family. Currently, I am exploring my Btech degree at Government Engineering College Palakkad.
I am very interested in coding . That was the reason I chose to pursue higher studies in IT(Information Technology).
 Post that, my internship experience and other practical projects in the college further boosted my interest in Programming and Web developing
 as a full-time career option.<br>
Not only am I passionate about the field I graduated in IT, I am also inclined towards creative activities such as dancing, painting, acting, etc. 
I have always been an active student in school and college. I have been participated in many cultural events during my school and college days and have won many awards.
In my free time, I enjoy going out with friends and trying new cuisines. I also enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading, working out, and going on road 
trips.</p>
